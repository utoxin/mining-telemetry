mining-telemetry=Mining Telemetry

[mod-description]
mining-telemetry=Adds new circuit network signals to miners and resource extractors (like pumpjacks) to enable advanced circuit network logic and monitoring.

[mod-setting-name]
mining-telemetry-default-no-resources-signal=Default "No Resources" Signal
mining-telemetry-disable-entity-counter-when-depleted=Disable entity counter when depleted

[mod-setting-description]
mining-telemetry-default-no-resources-signal=The default signal to use when a mining drill or pumpjack has no resources to extract. This can be overridden per-entity in the circuit network GUI.
mining-telemetry-disable-entity-counter-when-depleted=When enabled, the entity counter signal will not be output when the mining drill has no resources to extract, instead of outputting the "no resources" signal.

[mining-telemetry]
gui-title=Mining Telemetry
entity-counter-label=Entity counter
entity-counter-tooltip=Outputs a signal with the entity's icon and value of 1, useful for counting entities on a circuit network.
no-resources-label=No resources signal
no-resources-tooltip=Outputs the configured signal with value of 1 when this entity has no resources to extract.
no-resources-signal-tooltip=The signal to use for the no resources indicator. Leave blank to use the global default setting.
effective-resources-label=Effective resources
effective-resources-tooltip=Outputs the total effective resources available in the patch, accounting for mining productivity and any miner features (like reduced resource drain).
